325 km2. The terrain and climate are similar to Ireland with temperate maritime conditions modified

by the North Atlantic Current. The island experiences mild winters, cool summers, is consistently humid

and often overcast. Terrain is mountainous to rolling interior plain surrounded by rugged hills and low

mountains, sea cliffs on SW and SE coasts. Berylia is in a strategic location on major air and sea routes

between North America and northern Europe. Berylia’s boundaries and maritime claims:

Total area: 22 564 km.

territorial sea: 12 nm

contiguous zone: 24 nm

exclusive economic zone: 200 nm

**Population/Society**

Population distribution is concentrated around urban areas, with over 15% of the population residing

within 100 km of the capital, Bancroft.

Population (January 2022 est): 47,260,584. Ethnic groups: Berylian 70%, Crimsonian 25%, other 5%

Urbanization: 68% of total population (2022)

Major urban areas: Bancroft (capital), Paldar, Koat, Bakun (Prophyria region), Elev.

Although ethnic Berylians make up the majority of the population, there is a significant Crimsonian

element in the southern Prophyria region where they constitute a majority. Some of this group wish

to gain greater autonomy within Berylia with an extremist group seeking total independence with

greater ties to Crimsonia. The Anti Berylian Community (ABC) is a group formed of ethnic Crimsonians

throughout Berylia, but mostly focused in Bakun, Porphyria’s largest city. This group promotes the

ambitions of ethnic Crimsonians and proports to represent the entire community. Although nominally

a legitimate political party, it is suspected of being Crimsonia sponsored and is a front for Crimsonian

subversive activities. Its leader, known only as ‘Jelena’ is currently in gaol in the southern Berylian port

city of Roseiron for a range of offences associated with anti-democratic activities.

**Government**

Berylia is a democratic parliamentary republic led by a Prime Minister with a ceremonial presidency

who is the head of state. The current President of Berylia is **Berenice Banner.** During the last general

and local elections, a centre right coalition government was formed by Prime Minister **Raymond

Dubois**.

Berylia is a parliamentary democracy, a member of NATO, an associate member of the EU progressing

full membership status. As an associate member, Berylia has already implemented a huge part of the

*acquis communautaire* (for details see **Annexes D and E** ) in an effort to align its legal system with the

European Union.

Besides striving to implement European legislation, Berylia also positioned itself as a proponent of the

international rules based order, implementing international law and ascending to various international

conventions and treaties (for details see **Annex II** ).

Relations between Berylia and Crimsonia have been poor since the end of the WWI in which Berylia

sided with the UK and France and Crimsonia with Germany. More recently during the Cold War Berylia

sided with the West and Crimsonia with the East. After the end of the Cold War Berylia joined NATO

despite significant pressure from Crimsonia to prevent this with the implied threat of military and

economic action. This caused some concern among other NATO members, which prevented progress

beyond partner status for some time after the initial application to join the alliance.

**Annex A

International Relations**

Berylia has a long-standing territorial dispute with Crimsonia and the sea between the two nations has

been hotly disputed. The most recent disagreement has been over valuable natural resources including

natural gas deposits, which are known to be in the waters between Crimsonia and Berylia. 25 years

ago, both countries briefly engaged in active exploration to determine the extent of these reserves,

which heightened tension in the region. In an effort to legitimize an extended claim to the waters

between the two nations, Crimsonia has taken measures to expand its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

This involved expanding and building on a number of previously uninhabited rocky outcrops into larger

artificial islands 200nm from Crimsonia's northern coast and 100nm to the south of Berylia. Work on

the islands commenced 2 0 years ago but paused briefly after intense international pressure and

mediation by the UN. However, Crimsonia recommenced construction of the artificial islands 5 years

ago and completed their construction a year later. The boundary of the EEZ between Crimsonia and

Berylia is now a matter of dispute between the two nations. Berylia refuses to recognise the legitimacy

of the artificial islands, which would extend Crimsonia’s claim to the waters up to 50nm from its coast.

Although the larger of these artificial islands have extensive harbour and airport facilities, some of

them are poorly constructed and are vulnerable to erosion by storms and from the sea. As a result, a

small number are populated by only a small number of Crimsonian military personnel with their

infrastructures in a poor state of repair.

Some of the smaller artificial islands are also suspected of being used as a base for pirates operating

in the region, which harass and attack Berylian shipping. Berylia has made several requests to

Crimsonia for assistance in stopping the attacks, which have been unsuccessful. The issue was raised

by Berylia in the UN for a resolution but hopes for a successful outcome stalled with Crimsonia’s

traditional international supporters preventing the issue from being debated. The relationship

between the Crimsonian authorities and the pirates is unclear, but it is suspected that they are

operating under the unofficial approval of the Crimsonian government. Crimsonia`s refusal to help

combat piracy from their manmade islands is an ongoing issue between the two countries. In the past

Berylia has sought help from its allies to counter this threat by using cyber operations, which achieved

a temporary cessation in activity.

**Recent history**

The legal status of the artificial islands with regards to the boundaries of the Exclusive Economic Zone

(EEZ) between the two countries remains a significant issue. Berylia has refused to acknowledge the

## 4

## TLP: GREEN

Filtri tee 12 Phone: +372 717 6800

10132 Tallinn Fax: +372 717 6308

status of the artificial islands and recognises the EEZ as being equidistant between Berylia and

Crimsonia approximately 150nm from their coasts. However, Crimsonia demanded their islands be

included in its claim, which would reduce Berylia’s EEZ to 50nm from its southern coastline.

During negotiations in 2020 to define the EEZ boundary, a UN committee determined that the islands

could not be included as Crimsonian territory due to their artificial extension, further increasing

tensions. Crimsonia immediately stated that they did not recognise the UN committee’s findings and

that they would continue to regard the islands as fundamental to determining the EEZ boundary. This

resulted in some UN sanctions, but over time these have expired and the status quo remains.

The issue of the EEZ became the focus of relations between Berylia and Crimsonia again in Summer

2022 when Berylia discovered significant natural gas deposits in an area 100nm from its southern

coast. In December 2022, the advanced drill ship ‘MV Kangur’ identified the optimal location for

Berylia’s first gas platform, ‘Galbreath 1’. Despite Crimsonian opposition, this platform was successfully

established in position in the late Winter of 2023 with a gas pipeline laid to the southern Beryian port

of Roseiron. Due to the size of the gas fields and the quantity of that can be transferred ashore,

Berylia’s plans to export some as Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). LNG gasification, handling, transfer and

storage facilities have been built in Roseiron, which to be the hub of Berylia’s new energy industry.

**Annex B

Economy**

Berylia has a modern, service-oriented economy. Recent discoveries of elements such as Lithium and

Cobalt have led to new industries producing batteries for Electric Vehicles. A thriving drone industry is

the leading high-tech sector with strong exports. The leading company in the drone industry is Kaktus,

which is also the largest defence manufacturer in country with its main plant located in Elev. Berylia’s

sole gas supplier is ‘BERGAS’, which is a public private partnership. The Berylian state owns 51% of the

shares with the remainder sold to private enterprise.

Berylia GDP: $1,393,351,000,000 GDP per capita: $ 29,

Overall unemployment rate 9%; unemployment rates among ethnic groups: Berylians 4,5%,

Crimsonians 20%.

Key imports: machinery and equipment, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, transportation equipment.

Key exports: Natural gas, Lithium, Cobalt, EV batteries, drone parts, refined petroleum, packaged

medicines, clothing.

**National infrastructure**

The transportation network in Berylia is well developed with modern and reliable transport. This is

utilised for both civilian purposes and for the movement of heavy military equipment.

Berylia has several major international airports located in Bancroft, Baldar, Koat, Elev and Bakun.

Bakun and Koat are dual-use civilian and military airports.

The Busiest Sea Port of Debarkation (SPODs) in Berylia is Paldar, which covers an area of 240 ha and

has handled 140 million tons of freight every year since 2013. Other significant ports are located in

Elev and Koat. Roseiron has undergone a significant programme of expansion to enable it to handle

LNG vessels.

Roads – The road system is well designed and is suitable for carrying heavy and long-distance vehicular

traffic. Three lane carriageways connect Bancroft with all the major cities of the country and provides

unrestricted access to the main ports. The number of cars, buses and goods vehicles on Berylia roads

has increased over the years competing with the railway network, which has traditionally been used

for transportation of goods and passengers. Commercial transportation still relies mostly on rail with

approximately 65% of commercial hauling using this nationalised network. Major railways are the

Bakun – Koat (N-S line) and Paldar – Elev (E-W line) with the major hub for railroad interconnections

in Bancroft.

Communication – see Communication and Information.

Medical – Berylia has universal health care and is free at point of delivery, paid for by taxation. Medical

care is to European standard. Each county has facilities for primary health care with medical and dental

facilities. Primary Healthcare services are available within a 15-minute radius from any place of

residence. Major cities all have role 4 medical facilities located in Bancroft, Paldar, Koat, Elev, Carcastle,

Mizim, Bakun and Portsmith. These healthcare centres are staffed by multidisciplinary teams

comprising of general practitioners, paediatricians, nurses, and administrative staff, as well as, in some

cases, social workers, midwives and physiotherapists. Janford Virology Institute specialises beside

research also for treatment of patients with rare and infectious disease. Every major City has role 1

medical facilities.

**Energy**

Berylia’s energy sector will need an investment of 1,5Bn Kroon annually to reach 5% growth in the

coming years (1 Kroon is roughly comparable to 1 Euro). Most of this investment will be allocated for

upgrading transmitting systems, and the building of new gas powered generation facilities to replace

the coal fired stations.

Energy production: Until the new gas resources are exploited, 258.6 billion kWh (2020 est.) are

generated from domestic and imported coal providing 45% of total installed capacity (2020 est.)

Hydroelectric plants provide 2% of total installed capacity (2021 est.) and 35% of total installed

capacity from renewable sources (2021 est.). Total consumption: 239.5 billion kWh annually (2016 est.)

The country has constructed several artificial reservoirs for power production services. Reservoirs of

hydropower stations often serve as a source of drinking water, irrigation or fishing. The largest

reservoirs, which also serve as hydropower stations are Elev and Tettlewick, supplied by the rivers

Anian and Daix.

Berylia’s energy generation sites are as follows:

**Communications and Information infrastructure**

Berylia has a mix of legacy and modern telecommunications infrastructure. After the Government’s re-

election, its reliance on information systems have increased. The constitution of Berylia provides for

freedom of speech, and a free and open press and has historically enjoyed a high level of press

freedom. However, recent changes in law have provided the Government with increased powers to

control the media and public discourse in times of national crisis.

Berylia has several private and public media channels. The Ministry of Communication and Information

is the government’s legislative body responsible for shaping policy, drafting legislation, and providing

regulatory oversight over the industry through three Offices of State. These are The Office of Press and

Mass Communications, The Office of IT, which hosts CERT_BER, and The Office of Communications.

The Office of Communications is responsible for government information systems and

telecommunications, physical communications systems, satellite and high-frequency communications

and cryptography services, and frequency management. The Office of Power Distribution is

responsible for controlling power production and distribution systems security. All other ministries

have management bodies for controlling their own IT systems.

Berylia’s Computer Emergency Response Team was established 15 years ago and is responsible for the

management of security incidents in computer networks. Its task is to assist Berylian Internet users in

the implementation of preventive measures to reduce potential damage from security incidents and

to help them to respond to security threats. This unit deals with security incidents that occur in Berylian

networks and can be contacted by citizens or institutions either in Berylia or abroad.

Berylia has 94 million telephone subscribers of which 20% are fixed line and 80% mobile. Major service

provider for mobile services is Global TELECOM Company (GTC) with 3 other smaller providers. GTC

hosts the undersea cables to Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Little Xurg with cable landing stations in

Paldar, Glassmore, Roseiron, and Pineland. Network coverage is fast and mostly 4G based but major

cities also have 5G with extensive coverage allowing internet and mobile phone subscribers’ access in

even the most remote areas. Fibre optic cables in Berylia are managed by SW Telecom Company and

PUUCOM. Berylia hosts several satellite ground stations.

There are three internet exchange points (IXP) in the country; Paldar, Glassmore and Pineland. There

are also two data centres located in Paldar and Bancroft.

As Berylia is an associate member of the European Union and as such already implemented the General

Data Protection Regulation in its national body of law, the High Commissioner for Data Protection has

been established in Bancroft as the highest ranking data protection authority in Berylia.

**Media**

Television and radio play a significant role in Berylian politics, sports and culture with a range of

terristorial and online channels. More than 90% of the country, including the Crimsonian diaspora,

have subscriptions to television channels. Berilyan TV1 is the government owned TV station.

As for television, radio has also seen a proliferation of channels due to digital technology. There are at

least two hundred radio stations in Berylia with most of them independent companies live-streaming

music, education and talk radio available on smartphones, computers and conventional receivers. The

government views radio as a strategic asset and an important tool to unite the country and when

necessary, provide information during emergencies.

The state owns and operates national radio stations reaching a wide audience on the FM band and

digitally online or via Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM). The main broadcast studios are in Bancroft with

regional facilities and news bureaus. Newspapers are the second most popular media in Berylia after

television. The industry is owned by several major news agencies that publishes around 25 daily

editions. Despite low advertising revenues and circulation, readership is increasing due to online access

being subject to the industry regulator.

Recent statistics show that nearly 90% of the population is connected to the Internet, with that number

expected to grow in coming years. Encrypted end-to-end messaging services are popular with their use

widespread across the demographic groups. There are approximately 30 million active social media

users.

Online security issues including malware, abuse of personal information, financial losses or accessing

inappropriate websites is an increasing concern in Berylia. A survey by the national internet research

group (IRG) discovered that a quarter of all internet users have encountered security problems, with

many of them suspected as originating from Crimsonia. Additionally, Crimsonia has been suspected of

conducting several campaigns of cyber-attacks against Berylian CNI.

**Annex C

Military**

The national defence of Berylia is conducted on the principles of civilian control inherently bound with

the democratic organisation of the state. Democratically elected and appointed executive institutions

make decisions on the role and employment of the defence forces and provide direction, resource

allocation and monitor the attainment of their objectives. The implementation of the principles of

civilian control is guaranteed by defence-related rights, obligations and responsibilities legislatively laid

upon the parliament, the President, and the Government of the Republic.

The highest position of national defence is the President of the Republic who is advised in national

defence matters by the National Defence Council. This comprises the Chairman of the Parliament, the

## 8

## TLP: GREEN

Filtri tee 12 Phone: +372 717 6800

10132 Tallinn Fax: +372 717 6308

Prime Minister, the Chief of the Defence Forces (the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces in

wartime) and the Defence Minister. Other advisers include the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Minister

of Foreign Affairs and the Chairman of the Parliamentary National Defence Committee. Executive

power in the leadership of the national defence is executed by the Government of the Republic.

The Berylian Defence Force (BDF) strategic objectives are the development and maintenance of a

credible capability to defend the nation's vital interests. This includes the development of the BDF to

ensure their interoperability with other NATO nations and provide a capability to participate in the full

range of military missions.

In peacetime the main tasks of BDF are to monitor and maintain control over territorial borders and

airspace, maintain combat readiness, train conscripts, and develop reserve units. This also includes

participation in international missions and providing assistance to civilian authorities in case of national

emergencies.

In time of crisis the main tasks of BDF are to increase the readiness levels of units as required, prepare

for transition to wartime structures and begin mobilization when ordered. The BDF will also integrate

elements from other ministries and prepare for assistance from and reception of friendly forces.

In wartime the main tasks of BDF are to defend the territorial integrity of the state and facilitate the

arrival and deployment of forces from other countries. Subsequently, the BDF will co-operate with

them to maintain control over national airspace and maritime areas. Berylian military strategy is

reliant on high tech weapons systems and the use of advanced drones is a key element of this

strategy. The BDF have invested heavily in drone technology which is highly integrated in the overall

command structure. However, recent years budget cuts have led to a situation where there are not

enough personnel to run full scale military operations particularly in high technology areas. Service in

the armed forces is not considered popular and following political instability and budget cuts

numbers have decreased to their lowest since the end of the Cold War. In 2021 the Berylian military

comprises approximately 80,000 total active-duty troops (65% Army; 20% Navy, 5% marines; 10% Air

Force). The Berylian Marine forces HQ is at Paldar. Marine Forces HQ is collocated with Naval HQ.

Marine TF South troops are based in Paldar (1 Amphib Bde) and Naval TF E Koat (2 Amphib Bde).

**Land Forces**

The Berylian Land Force is the main arm of the defence forces with the Land forces HQ located in

Bancroft. The army’s operational structure consists of four mechanised infantry DIV. The Land Force

development priorities are twofold. Firstly, the capability to perform operations to protect the territory

of Berylia alone or in co-operation with allies. The second requirement is to be able to participate in

missions outside the national territory.

The location of the mechanized infantry divisions are:

1 MID Btn – Bancroft

2 MID Btn – Bakun

3 MID Btn – Paldar

4 MID Btn - Koat

The Berylian Signal Brigade is formed of four Battalions with Headquarters located as follows:

1 Sig Btn – Bancroft

2 Sig Btn – Paldar

3 Sig Btn – Bakun

4 Sig Btn - Koat

**Maritime Forces**

The Berylian Navy is responsible for all naval operations and for the protection of the territorial waters

and EEZ. The primary role of the naval force are the preparation and organisation of the defence of

the territorial waters and coastline. This involves maintaining maritime security, communications and

protection of sea traffic in territorial waters in co-operation with the navies of friendly countries. In

crisis situations the Navy defends sea approaches, harbour areas, sea lines of communication and co-

operates with allied units. The Navy comprises small patrol ships, minesweepers, a frigate and coast

guard units. The Naval forces HQ is situated at the Paldar naval base with other bases at Koat and Elev.

Naval TF South has an Amphibious Brigade of marines based in Paldar.

**Air Forces**

The Air Force provides the air defence of Beryalia, an air transport capability and a small Search and

Rescue detachment. The Air Defence Wing is located at the military airbases of Bancroft, Carcastle and

Glassmore.

**Cyber Command**

The BDF Cyber Command is located in Bancroft and is responsible for conducting cyber operations to

provide support to the Ministry of Defence's area of responsibility. Its tasks include ensuring the

operation of IT services and conducting defensive and offensive cyber operations. The Cyber Command

includes the operation of the Signal Brigade and the Cyber Operations Center. Cyber command has a

Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement with the national CERT for protection of the CNI.

The BDF have invested in Cyber Defence engagement with research institutes and universities to

leverage people, processes, and technology in the development of new capabilities.

**Special Operations**

The Special Operations Component Command (SOCC) directs all of Berylia’s Special Forces although

Operational Control (OPCON) of individual units is typically retained by the respective service

command. SOCC HQ is located in Bancroft. Special Operations Command has conducted operational

deployments in-country and overseas both in support of national and international missions. Special

Forces (SF) units are under the Land Forces Command (the 2nd and 8th SF Brigades) and Maritime

Forces (Naval Special Reconnaissance Battalion SF).

**Joint Logistics**

Joint Logistics Component Command (JLCC) is responsible for the planning, coordination, and delivery

of military logistics. This includes developing joint logistics capabilities and requirements, explosive

ordnance, fuel services, joint movements, logistics information systems, and Defence supply chain

warehousing, distribution, materiel maintenance and retail store services. The JLCC is located in

Pineland.

**Information and Intelligence**

The Information and Intelligence Service (IIS) is co-located with the General Staff and is responsible for

providing strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence for the Armed Forces. Its principal mission

involves the collection of indications and warnings intelligence, data on advanced military technologies

and specific information on the intentions and military capabilities of potential adversaries. Collection

techniques include gathering open-source information (OSINT), acquiring overt and clandestine

human intelligence (HUMINT), conducting satellite and aircraft imagery reconnaissance (IMINT) and

collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) from various platforms. The IIS has a strong HUMINT covert

surveillance and source handling capability, and its personnel frequently deploy alongside BER SF

elements, especially on foreign intelligence collection operations. The IIS is also responsible for ISR

collection through reconnaissance aircraft and UAV. The Armed Forces of BER extensively use

unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to conduct reconnaissance and possesses a wide range of smaller

UAV for use at the tactical level.

a total land area of 243 610 km^2. The terrain and climate are similar to those of France with temperate

maritime conditions modified by the North Atlantic Current. The island experiences mild winters, hot

summers with an occasional strong, cold, dry, north-to north-westerly wind. Crimsonia’s terrain is

mostly flat with mountains in coastal regions and the NE of the country. It has one major island of

Vlando. Crimsonia is in a strategic location on major air and sea routes between North America and

northern Europe. Crimsonia’s boundaries and maritime claims are:

Total are: 12 429 km^2.

Territorial sea: 12 nm

Contiguous zone: 24 nm

**Government**

Crimsonia is a weak parliamentary democracy with a very strong political oligarchy. The President

**Babak Landvik** is head of state. In reality, the Crimsonian Parliament performs little more than an

advisory body to the President as the country has slowly transitioned towards a more autocratic form

of government. Political oligarchies and the elite have considerable influence over political power

within the county. Crimsonia has a low level of press freedom and human (including privacy) rights are

not well protected. A visa is required to visit Crimsonia.

Crimsonia is a member of the UN but is neither a member of NATO or the EU and has not ratified the

Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. Although the country is a State Party of the European

Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as amended (ECHR),

concerns have been raised in the past for non-compliance. Relations between Crimsonia and its closest

neighbour Berylia have been poor since the end of the WWI in which Crimsonia sided with Germany

with Berylia siding with the UK and France. More recently during the Cold War Crimsonia sided with

the East and Berylia with the West. After the end of the Cold War Crimsonia resisted Berylia’s

application to join NATO and issued veiled threats of military and economic action. Although this

caused some concern among other NATO members, Berylia was ultimately successful with its

application to join the alliance.

between the Crimsonian authorities and the pirates is unclear, but it is suspected that they are

operating under the unofficial approval of the Crimsonian government. Crimsonia`s refusal to help

combat piracy from their manmade islands is an ongoing issue between the two countries. In the past

Berylia has sought help from its allies to counter this threat by using cyber operations, which achieved

a temporary cessation in activity.

**Recent history**

At the beginning of 2022 Berylia was in possession of the eastern artifical island known as ‘Little Xurg’.

This island was previously abandoned by Crimsonia due to erosion and later used as a base by pirates

and pro-Crimsonian rebels. After taking control of Little Xurg, Berylia was able to stabilise the island’s

geology and significantly improved its infrastructure. This included building a substantial port and

associated facilities, including an undersea fibre optic link to Berylia. As a result of being under control

of both Berylia and Crimsona in the recent past, the island is thus unique in having data communication

links to both countries.

Berylia’s occupation of Little Xurg became a focus for increasing tension with Crimsonia as the harbour

was used as a base for drillships engaged in exploratory offshore drilling of new oil and gas wells. Its

ownership was also significant as the artificial islands were key to Crimsonia’s demands that they be

included in defining the boundaries of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) between the two countries.

Berylia has refused to acknowledge the status of the artificial islands and recognised the EEZ as being

equidistant between Berylia and Crimsonia approximately 150nm from their coasts. However,

Crimsonia continues to demand that the islands be included in its claim.

During negotiations in 2020 to define the EEZ boundary, a UN committee determined that the islands

could not be included as Crimsonian territory due to their artificial extension, further increasing

tensions. Crimsonia immediately stated that they did not recognise the UN committee’s findings and

that they would continue to regard the islands as fundamental to determining the EEZ boundary. This

resulted in some UN sanctions, but over time these have expired, and the status quo remains. The legal

status of the artificial islands with regards to the boundaries of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)

between the two countries remains a significant issue.

Tensions increased in Spring 2022 when Crimsonia launched a devastating series of cyberattacks on

Beryia to compromise their defences prior to invading Little Xurg. As of late 2022, Crimsonia is in

control of all the artificial islands although the dispute over the EEZ remains. This issue again became

the focus of relations between Berylia and Crimsonia in Summer 2022 when Berylia discovered

significant natural gas deposits in an area 100nm from its southern coast. This discovery is in the area

that is claimed by both countries and immediately resulted in the navyies of both countries patrolling

the area.

In December 2022, the advanced drill ship ‘MV Kangur’ identified the optimal location for Berylia’s first

gas platform, ‘Galbreath 1’. Despite Crimsonian opposition, this platform was successfully established

in position in the late Winter of 2023 with a gas pipeline laid to the southern Beryian port of Roseiron.

Due to the size of the gas fields and the quantity of that can be transferred ashore, Berylia’s plans to

export some as Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). LNG gasification, handling, transfer, and storage facilities

have been built in the southern Berylian ports of Roseiron, which to be the hub of the country’s new

energy industry.

**Annex B

Economy**

Crimsonia has a mix of modern and legacy economic systems with much of the economy controlled by

a select group of oligarchs. There is evidence of extensive corruption and extortion in many sectors.

The country is historically agriculturally oriented, and this accounts for a significant proportion of its

GDP and its industrial infrastructure also reflects this focus. More recently, there has been some

limited revenue from small oil and gas reserves that have been discovered within its territorial waters

and which are seen as a route to future prosperity. Crimsonia’s state run energy supplier _Crimsonia

International Gas Exchange_ (CRINGE) is run by the Presidents family and is suspected of being a source

of their personal wealth. Crimsonia also mines a range of minerals including coal, potassium salt, iron,

chromium, and uranium, which gives the country the potential for future wealth. The Ministry of

Industry controls prospecting and mining rights. Main industrial centres are Olkburg and Ugrark. The

uranium mine infrastructure in the Vrodnard is a potential source for further industrialisation and

processing. Several thousand employees are already working and living there.

The Crimsonian economy is heavily dependent on world commodity prices as reliance on exports

makes it vulnerable to boom-and-bust cycles that follow the volatile swings in global prices. The global

financial slowdown resulting from the war in Ulkraine has severely affected Crimsonia’s economy due

to reduced demand for its natural resources. Falling home prices, high consumer debt, and subsequent

inflation compounded Crimsonia’s economic problems, pushing the economy into recession in the

latter half of 2022. This prompted the government to implement a number of measures to stimulate

the economy and stabilize the financial markets. Facing burgeoning public deficits and debt levels,

government initiated an austerity program, which has continued.

Crimsonia GDP: $$1,836,251,770,000 GDP per capita: ~$$ 27,

Overall unemployment rate 10%

Key imports: gas turbines, gold, packaged medicines, agricultural and transportation equipment.

Key exports: coal, potassium salt, iron, chromium, crude and refined petroleum, natural gas,

agricultural products.

**National infrastructure**

Transportation – The Crimsonian national infrastructure is not well developed. Projects to Improve the

railway and road networks are underway, but citizens have been told not expect to see significant

benefits within the next 5 years. These projects are estimated to finish in ten years’ time with the focus

being in and around the capital city Strin, which has a reasonably well-developed transportation

infrastructure. However, transports links in the rural areas remain poor. The maintenance of the

transport infrastructure is tightly controlled by national and regional bodies that ensure the

prioritisation of any construction work is consistent with Crimsonian political and defence priorities.

Some state enterprises maintain highways and main roads, the local authorities maintain the regional

roads under their administration.

## 16

## TLP: GREEN

Filtri tee 12 Phone: +372 717 6800

10132 Tallinn Fax: +372 717 6308

Commercial transportation relies primarily on rail and road transport, at 35% and 65% respectively.

Road transport is the primary means of passenger transport, particularly in the rural areas, where the

railway network is limited or missing. There is an ongoing project to develop a highway network

suitable for heavy vehicles that connects Strin with all the major cities of the country and improve an

existing corridor that links Strin with Xurg.

Air Point of Departure - Crimsonia has 12 airport facilities, two of which (Strin, Olkburg) are capable of

accommodating international flights. Last year, Strin airport, as the main international gateway, served

6.7M passengers. Dual civilian and miliary airports are Xurg and Vrodnard. Local airports serve both

general and private aviation. CRIMAIR is the state-owned airline company with the largest aircraft fleet

that provides domestic and international services. Viavos, a state-owned company, manages the two

international and other larger airports with the municipal authorities managing the the local ones.

Sea Point of Departure - Major ports are Olkburg, Strin and Vlando. Olkburg is Crimsonia’s primary port

facility and covers an area of 200 ha and has handled 150 million tons of freight every year since it was

completed. It is used for the export of agricultural and natural resources. In recent years, the port at

Xurg has been developed heavily and is related with the military modernisation program.

Railway - The railway system consists of more than 4,000 kilometres of railway track. However, only

600 kilometres are in common carrier service including the main railway line between Strin-Olkburg-

Upul-Vlando. The remaining railways serve specific industries or are dedicated lines not available for

common carrier use. One line between Olkburg and Xurg is dedicated for military purposes. A major

modernization of the railway system and its components is underway although currently less than 50%

of the locomotives and freight rolling stock have been upgraded.

Waterways - There is a small daily ferry connection from Upul to the nearby island of Vlando, which is

popular with fishermen and tourists. The inland waterways consist of a limited navigable system

deemed not cost suitable for expansion. Nevertheless, specific parts of the existing waterway system

are under development for military purposes.

Water - Due to its geographical location and terrain, there are no significant issues regarding water

supply and distribution. According to a UN report, the water quality in some cities and towns was

poorer than excepted. However, the Crimsonian Water Supply Organisation (CWSO), a state-controlled

enterprise, has recently applied a new strategy for the management of water resources. This includes

and investment programme for the annual maintenance and ongoing renovation of the water network.

Recently, new standards have been implemented governing water treatment technology and policies.

The Crimsonia Local Water Company (CLWC) manages the water distribution network under their

administration and regularly monitors the water quality from source to consumer.

Medical – major cities have Role 1 facilities.

**Energy**

Crimsonia’s power generation capacity is sufficient to fulfil the domestic demand. The government has

ambitious plans to modernise the entire energy sector to further increase efficiency and reduce costs

to stimulate the economy. However, this plan relies upon the availability of plentiful supplies of cheap

## 17

## TLP: GREEN

Filtri tee 12 Phone: +372 717 6800

10132 Tallinn Fax: +372 717 6308

natural gas to replace older and more expensive coal powered stations. There are also plans to upgrade

existing hydropower stations or build new ones to take advantage of the country’s hydropower

potential, but progress has slowed due to funding issues.

Energy production: Crimsonia’s energy production capacity is 220 GWh with consumption being 210

000 GWh. 71% is derived from fossil fuels, 23% from hydroelectric plants and 6% from other renewable

sources.

**Agriculture**

Main arable areas are around Daka and Streka. Streka is a major seaport for exporting agricultural

products.

**Communications and Information**

The telecommunication system in Crimsonia is being updated and the country has invested

significantly in modern information communication technology (ICT). Ongoing telecommunication

projects aim to further modernize existing communication infrastructure. The telecommunications

sector has seen continuous growth over the past decade with a cluster of companies offering various

ICT services with most being monitored by state organisations.

**Administration**

The Ministry of IT and Communication is the government’s legislative body responsible for shaping

policy, drafting legislation, and providing regulatory oversite over the industry. The Ministry does this

primarily through four subordinate agencies. The Communication authority is responsible for

maintaining government information systems and telecommunication lines. It also controls

## 18

## TLP: GREEN

Filtri tee 12 Phone: +372 717 6800

10132 Tallinn Fax: +372 717 6308

Crimsonia’s physical communications systems, high-frequency communications, satellite,

cryptography services, and frequency management. It is a special-status agency with authority to

monitor all government and private information services as well as collect information domestically

and internationally. The Media Authority is responsible for licensing Crimsonia’s broadcast and paper

media. In reality, the Media Authority ensures that products are consistent with the President’s official

line. The IT Authority is responsible for networked infrastructure. Its main role is to ensure that the

government is aware of all infrastructure projects and for enforcing the use of only government

approved cryptographic systems. The Truth authority is in charge of censorship and its relevance has

gained with the growth and popularity of the internet. The agency has been granted special powers

that allow it to operate without recourse of the courts.

**Communication infrastructure**

The country has a mix of legacy and modern telecommunications infrastructure, managed by the state.

Cross-country digital trunk lines connect the country from East to West and from North to South. Major

cities have fibre optic cabling, while legacy copper cable connections are still popular in domestic

households. A modern digital infrastructure has been installed in all big cities and has both analogue

and digital services, which have been expanding rapidly and cover almost the entire country. State

surveillance of the population is widespread.

Satellite communication channels are provided by the Revalia Xanadu Telecom.

Crimsonia has 120 million subscribers of which 20% are fixed line and 80% mobile communications.

The main service provider for mobile services is Global TELECOM Company (GTC), with a smaller, less

popular provider (Tomato IT Services). Crimconnexion, a state-affiliated ISP, provides 5G to the

artificial islands and also owns the undersea cables to Casablanca, Hamilton and Little Xurg. The cable

landing stations are at Xurg and Vrodnard. Network coverage is fast and mostly 4G based, although

Strin, Olkburg and Xurg have 5G.

Transtelecom, state-owned entity, designed and built the backbone of the Crimsonian fibre optics

network. The company is responsible for Network operations and maintenance and has primary

responsibility for the manufacturing of fibre optic cable and data centres. There are data centres

located in Xurg and Strin together with Internet exchange points (IXP). Media reports claim the

government has hosted visits by Microhard officials who are interested in increasing their data centre

infrastructure in the country.

**Media**

The Crimsonian News Service is the official news service of the government, providing written, voice,

and visual news and information content to all domestic print, broadcast, and online media. It employs

more than 300 writers, editors, photographers, and freelancers domestically and internationally. It is

also the nation’s filter for incoming international news.

The Crimsonia Television and Radio Network (CTRN) is the nation’s national broadcaster. It is funded

by the taxpayers and through advertising revenues. The network was created nearly twenty years ago

under a government cost-saving plan.

## 19

## TLP: GREEN

There are a host of private-public partnerships in existence, although foreign ownership of any media

is limited to 20%. Ownership is privileged with all broadcast licensees belonging to individuals or groups

that financially back the party and support the President.

Crimsonians abroad have several independent media stations. Their influence in Crimsonia is

insignificant.

Historically radio has been primary source for transmitting news in Crimsonia and abroad. The

introduction of digital broadcasting has benefitted both radio owners and listeners. The digital format

has resulted in more stations, more programming options and clearer sound. There are many

advantages to digital broadcasting, but one area that does concern authorities is the ease in which

individuals and groups can create start-up online stations. Live streaming has become popular amongst

some, particularly the youth. Many of these stations however are closed down by the authorities

almost as soon as they come online.

Some popular broadcasting radio stations are:

1. Radio Crimsonia. The flagship station of state-run CTRN. It is available nationally and

   internationally online. The programming format is primarily talk radio covering government issues,

   domestic and international news, documentary, and cultural programming. International service

   broadcasts Crimsonian news, culture, and entertainment stories in over 10 languages around the

   world.

2. Xurg Voice. Majority-owned by the government and a subsidiary of CTRN, with more liberal

   editorial standards, providing talk shows, music, and entertainment. It is popular with listeners in Xurg

   and the surrounding area.

3. Radio Olkburg. A state-run national network providing music and entertainment.

While radio is popular, television is the main source for news for most Crimsonians. Television in

Crimsonia is transmitted on the DVB-T digital format, which is the same one used in Europe.

Popular TV stations are:

1. Crimsonian TV is the oldest, national, state-run TV station having been established 40 years

   ago. Production and broadcast facilities are at CTRN Headquarters in Strin. It is the government’s

   official television broadcaster for news information, current events, and emergency situations.

2. Strin24. This is a 24-hour channel that primarily serves international audiences. It is owned by

   the government and provides news, culture, and entertainment stories.

In addition to these four main channels, there is also a military channel run by the Ministry of War

(MoW). CRIMIL provides news and public affairs information about the country’s armed forces,

defence matters and security issues.

## TLP: GREEN

10132 Tallinn Fax: +372 717 6308

Paper print is not popular among Crimsonians and although the newspaper industry survived the

digital revolution several small newspapers and magazines closed down, resulting in hundreds of lay-

offs. The established publications have survived by making the required investments. Overall

distribution is down but subscription rates are increasing as online readership becomes more popular.

Journalism in the traditional sense no longer exists in Crimsonia. Government public affairs personnel

and those sympathetic to the President perform the role of journalists. They are often seen as ‘useful

idiots’ tasked to create fake news and spread lies by government spin-doctors. Although a free press

and free speech are guaranteed in the country’s constitution, the government has successful argued

in court that it has the right to rule as it sees fit. Sanctioned journalists or anyone who dares to publicly

express their dissatisfaction or oppose the government can expect to be fined or jailed.

Some major printed news sources are:

1. The Crimsonian Independent is oldest daily newspaper and began publishing in 1921. It is

   government owned but remains popular due to competitive pricing and an attractive blend of

   domestic and international news, coupled with popular articles on issues such as the arts, sport and

   music. Its Sunday edition also includes several additional supplements. The Crimsonian Independent

   is also published on-line and is popular with the Crimsonian diaspora, particularly within Berylia.

2. Weekly Life. The Weekly Life is a tabloid that is published weekly and focuses mainly on

   domestic issues and particularly those with a strong Crimsonian cultural flavour.

Social media - there were more than 46 million social media users in Crimsonia.

**Annex C

Military**

The Crimsonian Armed Forces are large and modern and led by the Defence Minister, **Conrad

Mcgowan**. Crimsonia is assessed as a peer adversary to the Berylian alliance with appropriate C2,

intelligence, cyber research, and non-linear warfare capabilities. Over the past decade, Crimsonia has

invested heavily in high-tech military capabilities including surface to surface and surface to air

missiles. They also have armed drones capable of operating on land, sea and in the air and more

recently have developed a potent cyber-enabled information operations and electronic warfare

capability. The stated rationale for this is to have technical parity or superiority to any regional rivals

to discourage any involvement in the Crimsonian sphere of influence.

Crimsonian military doctrine is based on their military strategist General Gera Simoff doctrine. This is

a whole-of-government concept that fuses hard and soft power across many domains and transcends

boundaries between peace- and wartime. This aims to achieve Information Advantage through a range

of influence activities involving both military and non-military means to destabilise and subvert an

adversary. Crimsonia’s military forces are led by the Minister of War through Joint Forces HQ. All major

components are represented.

**Maritime Forces**

The Crimsonian Navy is responsible for all naval operations and for the protection of the territorial

waters and EEZ of Crimsonia, including the protection of the artificial islands. The primary role of the

naval force is the preparation and organisation of the defence of the territorial waters and coastline.

This involves maintaining maritime security, communications, and sea traffic in the territorial waters.

The Navy HQ is located in Xurg, which is also the base for one Marine brigade (301). Its advanced Navy

is used to control Crimsonia territorial waters, including its artificial islands. The Navy comprises a

number of missile armed patrol boats, corvettes, mine sweepers and coast guard units. There are also

a number of former ferries that have been bought on the international market and converted into

amphibious warfare vessels equipped with landing craft.

**Land Forces**

Crimsonian Land Forces HQ is located in Streka. The Crimsonian army has three corps (Olkburg - 55,

Streka – 44, Strin -33) and is equipped with a combination of Russian and Chinese export model tanks,

artillery, and armoured personnel carriers. There is a Company of 150 Special Forces Troops attached

to 55 Corps at Olkburg.

**Air Forces**

Air Forces HQ is located in Xurg. The main role of the air force is to provide Air Defence, which includes

long range air defence systems. The air force also provides support to the land forces with dedicated

assets including a bomber group, air assault regiment and tactical transportation.

**Military Intelligence and Information Service**

The Military Intelligence and Information service is located in Strin. Its main tasks and composition is

not known. However, it is assessed to lead advisory task forces abroad as well as coordinate all

Information Operations activities, including cyber operations. Crimsonian government-backed projects

in higher education institutions and research institutes for IT R&D ensures a continuous output of

emulation and penetration testing software. Additionally, Crimsonia reportedly is suspected to have

ties with organized crime groups in Berylia. It is highly likely that this relationship is expanding in the

cyber domain with Crimsonia providing funding, training as well as human capital to the Anti Berylian

Community (ABC). Politically and financially motivated Digital Crime Groups linked with the ABC

supplements Crimsonia’s disinformation campaign to discredit the Berylian government by using bot

networks on social media. ABC members within Berylia are suspected of espionage and may be used

as insider threat actors as they can get physical access to crucial facilities. This may include reporting

on local Berylian military facilities and activities. Furthermore, even though Crimsonia does not need

proxies to bolster their own cyber capabilities, the ABC is suspected of providing proxies abroad. These

act as an intermediate for plausible deniability of their actions, especially with regard to the disruption

of System Applications and Products (SAP).

**Cyber Command**

The Crimsonian Cyber Command coordinates effects in cyberspace with Military Intelligence Services,

often using publicly available tools for plausible deniability. It consists of MIL CERT, IT support and

Cyber Defence Command Center.

**Support Command**

The Crimsonian support command is responsible for logistic support and for maintaining the

serviceability of equipment. As much of Crimsonia’s military hardware is of Russian or Chinese origin,

Crimsonia’s support command’s primary objective is to negotiate the continued supply of spares and

OEM technical expertise.

**Special Operations Command**

Crimsonia’s Special Operations Command is well equipped and trained. Modelled on the Russian

Spetnaz they are light infantry forces that are trained and configured for reconnaissance,

counterinsurgency, and power-projection missions. This role is suspected to range from battlefield

reconnaissance and behind-the-lines sabotage to training the ABC and supporting their insurgencies

and protests. Crimsonia’s special forces are increasingly geared toward “political warfare” operations,

reflecting Strin’s particular interest in integrating conventional military missions with covert “active

measures.”
